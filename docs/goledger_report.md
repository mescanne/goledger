Aggregated transaction reports

### Synopsis

Aggregated transactions reports

There are two basic dimensions for transactions reports:

Time period:
  If you look at a time period from the beginning of time
  until a point in time (eg now) you will see the total
  balance of all of the accounts.
  
  If you select a start and end date (eg beginning of this
  year until now) you will see the change in balance
  across all of the accounts.

Account Regexp:
  Normally, you don't want to see all accounts but focus
  on a particular subset of the accounts. Or a certain
  categorisation of accounts.
  
  Using regular expressions you can create income statements,
  balance sheets, and cashflow statements.

  Example for a balance sheet:
  Map all ^Income:.* and ^Expense.:* accounts into Equity. Also
  include all other accounts that aren't Asset:, Liability:,
  or Equity.

  This will leave just Asset and Liabilities.
